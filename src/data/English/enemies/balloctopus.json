But for your average careless diver, most of whom are tourists, a high-pressure water current of this kind can pose a significant threat. The thickness of diving equipment is therefore necessary for two reasons â€” firstly, to resist the pressure of the water itself, but secondly, to protect against the attacks of Fontemer Aberrants.",
