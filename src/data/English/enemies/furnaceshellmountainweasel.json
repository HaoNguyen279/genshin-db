After a prolonged existence in the ruins of the Sacred Mountain, its affinity for Phlogiston seems to have caused it to be influenced by the Source Mechanisms within the ruins, creating a unique symbiotic relationship between them.",

Some researchers from the Saurian Relics Association believe that despite the appearance that it has developed a symbiotic relationship with the Source Mechanisms, said mechanisms are actually controlling it through the ample Phlogiston that permeates its body."
