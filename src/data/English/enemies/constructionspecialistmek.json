Its name comes from an engineer employed by Callas during the construction of the Clementine Line.\nWith Callas' financial backing, this engineer built the legendary \"Golden Vessel\" â€” a gigantic piece of construction machinery which was used to dig the Poisson Tunnel. Once the job was complete, this type of clockwork meka was designed with a similar structure but reduced to a smaller scale.",
