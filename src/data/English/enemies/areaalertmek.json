Strictly speaking, it was originally a test device that emerged from research undertaken by the Institute of Natural Philosophy before the Fontaine Research Institute had been established.\nAs such, despite its considerable commercial success as a sentinel and defensive device, most engineers do not consider it to be a true clockwork meka.",
