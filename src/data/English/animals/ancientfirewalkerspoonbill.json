	"description": "A bird capable of freely swimming through liquid Phlogiston.\nHaving lived in volcanoes, its habits and appearance differ from Spoonbills found in the outside world. Some scholars posit that the Ancient Firewalker Spoonbill is to the Blue Mountain Spoonbill what the Flowfire Bird is to the Flowcurrent Bird. Others believe the Ancient Firewalker Spoonbill predates them all... If true, then it would seem that the Spoonbill species has always been of this size since time immemorial.",
