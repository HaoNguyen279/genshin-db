	"name": "Ancient Glazeback Turtle",
	"description": "A reptile with a thick shell encrusted with solid Phlogiston crystals.\nSimilar to other turtles in Teyvat, but this species lives in Phlogiston-rich areas which give rise to numerous deposits of solid Phlogiston on its shell. Some specimens have been known to appear outside the volcano due to eruptions. After studying them, researchers believe that these turtles have evolved at a slower pace than their modern-day counterparts.",
